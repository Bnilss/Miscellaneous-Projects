# Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch
Using a Kaggle xrays images *(imbalanced)* [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) containing the following classes:
- normal xrays
- covid19
- viral pneumonia

NB: *I attempted to train a pre-trained model (the resnet18) using pytorch to classify xray with a Validation-accuracy above 95%!
not intended to use in clinical practice just for educational purposes*
